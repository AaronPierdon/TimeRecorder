## What is Time Recorder
  Time recorder is a program that helps you track how much time you spend in a given task. This can be something done non-technical or something techincal, like using a program.
  
### How to Use
  For now, time reocrder is a Java application. It provides insight into how much time you spend in task via charts and graphs based on the input you provide.
  
#### What to excpect
  In the coming versions, TimeRecorder will automatically - after configuration - allow a users' activity to be recorded autononomously.
    This means sit back and use your softare; the program will tell you how much time you spend doing such.

##### Why

  This is a tool I needed to track my activity in programming versus video gamming. This is a project for learning, experience, and advancement; I welcome all who would like to contribute in any form or capaicty!
